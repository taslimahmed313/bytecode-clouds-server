The application of these concepts depends on the current state of technology and the price / performance objectives of the designer. The objective of the course is to provide a comprehensive discussion of the fundamentals of computer organization and architecture and relate them to contemporary design issues.A computer system is like any other system, it consists of a set of interrelated components. The system is best characterized in terms of structure, the way they are interconnected, and the function and operation of individual components. "

In this course, you will create relational databases, write SQL statements to extract information to satisfy business reporting requests, create entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) to design databases, and analyze table designs for excessive redundancy. As you develop these skills, you will use either Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL to execute SQL statements and a database diagramming tool such as the ER Assistant or Visual Paradigm to create ERDs. We've designed this course to ensure a common foundation for specialization learners. Everyone taking the course can jump right in with writing SQL statements in Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL."

    "details": "Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does 'something' (in this case, output 'Hi, I'm a PHP script!'). The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of 'PHP mode.'What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.The best part about using PHP is that it is extremely simple for a newcomer, but offers many advanced features for a professional programmer. Don't be afraid to read the long list of PHP's features. You can jump in, in a short time, and start writing simple scripts in a few hours."
